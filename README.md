The aim is to develop a machine learning model to predict specific medical conditions from text data sourced from Reddit posts. The goal is to create a tool that can assist in early detection and classification of various health conditions by analyzing patterns and content in social media posts.
The project focuses on multi-class classification of Reddit posts by subreddit using text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF and Word2Vec), and multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LSTM).
Models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices, with Word2Vec embeddings often outperforming TF-IDF in terms of predictive performance across traditional and deep learning classifiers.
